# solana-validator-ha

A gossip-based high availability (HA) manager for Solana validators. This tool helps automate **unexpected** failovers due to `<insert one of endless reasons>`.
To automate **planned** failovers, see [solana-validator-failover](https://github.com/SOL-Strategies/solana-validator-failover)

![active node handover](docs/active-node.png)

## Demo

`validator-1` (active) loses network connectivity. A passive peer detects the leaderless cluster and takes over automatically.

Passive node (`validator-2`) monitoring the cluster and promoting itself to active:

![passive node takeover](docs/passive-node.gif)

Active node (`validator-1`) detecting it has dropped from gossip and stepping down:

![active node handover](docs/active-node.gif)

## How it works

`solana-validator-ha` provides a simple, low-dependency HA solution for running 2 or more Solana validators together, where one is `active` (voting) and the rest are `passive` (non-voting). All peers share the same `active` keypair identity and each has its own unique `passive` keypair identity.

Each peer runs `solana-validator-ha` independently. It monitors the Solana gossip network to detect whether any peer is currently active and voting. When no active peer has been seen for a configurable number of consecutive samples (the _leaderless threshold_), a failover is triggered. Each peer makes this decision independently using the same gossip data, with a rank-based delay to prevent multiple peers from racing to become active simultaneously.

A node will only become active in a failover if:

1. It appears in gossip (the validator process is running and reachable on the network);
2. Its local RPC reports healthy, and both its processed and finalized slots are within `failover.self_healthy.max_slot_distance` of independent cluster RPCs;
3. It has been continuously healthy for at least `failover.self_healthy.minimum_duration` (guards against startup health flaps); and
4. Its live identity exactly matches the configured passive identity.

These checks establish candidacy only. Gossip absence, slot agreement and priority are not fencing. For mixed Firedancer/Agave deployments, the role command must positively fence the other signer, hold that fence throughout the transition, and enforce the client-specific tower safety delay. If it cannot fence the peer, it must refuse promotion. In particular, full Firedancer 26.09.4 cannot import a tower during a live identity switch and requires a 512-slot delay after the previous signer is fenced. An unreachable peer is not proof that its validator stopped.

To make this work, two (‼️**VERY**‼️) important user-supplied commands are required:

### 🟢 Active command

Called when this node should assume the `active` role. See [example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh](example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh) for inspiration.

```yaml
failover:
  active:
    command: "set-identity-with-rollback.sh"
    args: [
      "--active-identity-file", "{{ .ActiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
      "--passive-identity-file", "{{ .PassiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
    ]
```

### 🔴 Passive command

Called when this node should assume a `passive` (non-voting) role — a.k.a _Seppuku_. This command **must be idempotent**: it may be called any time the node detects it should not be active (e.g. when it drops out of gossip). The safest pattern is to configure validators to **always** start with a `passive` identity, so this command can simply restart the validator service and wait for it to come back passive. See [example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh](example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh) for inspiration.

```yaml
failover:
  passive:
    # ⚠️ This must make absolutely sure the validator goes passive.
    # ⚠️ If set-identity fails, restart/stop the service, pull the plug,
    # ⚠️ or call your mum crying for help. Do WHATEVER is necessary.
    command: "seppuku.sh"
    args: [
      "--passive-identity-file", "{{ .PassiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
    ]
```

> **Note:** `post-passive` hooks only run if the passive command succeeds, as a safeguard against false positives.

## Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Peer Detection**: Automatically detects validator roles based on network gossip and RPC identity
- **🛡️ Startup Health Protection**: Requires a configurable minimum continuous healthy streak before a node can become a failover candidate
- **🪝 Hooks**: Pre/Post failover hook support for role transitions
- **📊 Prometheus Metrics**: Rich metrics collection for monitoring and alerting
- **🏁 First-Responder Failover**: Race-based failover with deterministic rank-based delay so the highest-priority eligible passive validator assumes the active role. Default ordering is ascending IP sort; operators can override with explicit `failover.priority` per node
- **📼 Failover Recording**: Optionally writes a timestamped JSON file per failover with pre-failover gossip context, decision timeline, and outcome — for post-incident diagnosis and replay

  # The slow polls (poll_interval_duration) build confidence that the peer is genuinely down —
  # gossip can transiently drop a node for a single cycle and recover on the next. Fast-polling

  # to a transient blip is very low by that point.
  #
  # Example with poll_interval_duration: 5s, leaderless_samples_threshold: 3,

  # Both thresholds agree — there is no gap between delinquency detection and health status.

### Using Local RPC as a Failsafe Fallback

Public RPC endpoints can rate-limit or block requests (`403 Forbidden`, `429 Too Many Requests`), which prevents `getClusterNodes` from returning gossip data and causes log noise like:

```
ERRO [gossip_state]: failed to get cluster nodes
  error= method call failed on all RPC endpoints method: GetClusterNodes,
         attempted_urls: [https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com],
         errors: [403 "Access forbidden"]
```

Adding the local validator RPC alongside your remote URLs provides a fallback that is always available and never rate-limited:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: "mainnet-beta"
  rpc_urls:
    - "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"  # remote — may rate-limit
    - "http://localhost:8899"                # local — immune to rate limits
```

A warning is logged at startup to remind you of the trade-off:

```
WARN config: cluster.rpc_urls contains the local validator RPC URL (http://localhost:8899)
     — ensure HA peers are configured as mutual --entrypoint flags for direct gossip,
       otherwise peer state may be stale
```

#### When the local RPC is ideal: mutual `--entrypoint` flags

When each HA peer is listed as an `--entrypoint` in the other peers' agave config, they exchange gossip directly over UDP (CRDS). The local RPC then has sub-second fresh data for every peer — better than remote RPCs that see gossip after network propagation.

```
# On validator-1 (185.26.11.91)
--entrypoint validator-2.example.com:8001

# On validator-2
--entrypoint validator-1.example.com:8001
```

#### When the local RPC is a last-resort fallback

Without mutual `--entrypoint` flags, the local validator learns about peers through the wider gossip network. Peer data may be 30–60 s stale. This is still better than a complete `getClusterNodes` failure: the system keeps working with slightly older data rather than losing all visibility. The multi-URL retry logic means the remote URLs are always tried first; the local RPC is only reached if all remote calls fail.

#### Automatic URL cooldown

When any URL (local or remote) returns a `403`, `429`, or `503` response, `solana-validator-ha` automatically deprioritises that URL for 60 s and logs a warning:

```
WARN [rpc_client]: RPC endpoint rate-limited or access forbidden, cooling down
     method=GetClusterNodes url=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com cooldown=1m0s
```

During the cooldown the URL is still retried as a last resort, but healthy URLs are always attempted first.

## Delinquency Fast-Path

`solana-validator-ha` can optionally bypass the leaderless sample threshold when the Solana network itself declares the active peer delinquent via `getVoteAccounts`. Enable it with:

```yaml
failover:
  delinquency_bypass: true  # default: false
```

**What it does**: when the active peer is visible in gossip but declared delinquent (not due to a low vote account balance), failover is triggered immediately on the current gossip refresh — no further confirmation samples are needed.

**Why it can help — the "ghost validator" scenario**: the active validator is running and reachable in gossip but has stopped voting. Without the bypass, detection requires the full `leaderless_samples_threshold × poll_interval_duration` (~15 s at defaults) _on top of_ the delinquency detection time (~30–51 s). With the bypass, failover triggers as soon as delinquency is declared by the cluster.

**Why it is disabled by default — fork recovery risk**: a validator that lands on a minority fork will appear delinquent from the canonical chain's perspective, but may recover on its own once the fork dies. If the bypass fires during that window and the validator subsequently recovers, you risk two nodes briefly holding the active identity simultaneously — a double-signing scenario. The leaderless sample threshold provides a natural recovery window: if the validator comes back and votes again, the next gossip refresh clears the delinquency flag and the failover is aborted.

**When it is safe to enable**: if your validator can enter a "ghost" state — running, in gossip, but permanently stopped voting — that it cannot self-recover from, and your network conditions make prolonged minority forks very unlikely. Most operators running on well-connected infrastructure with stable peers do not need this.

**Low-balance exemption**: validators delinquent due to a sub-rent-exempt vote account balance (~0.00089 SOL) are explicitly excluded from the bypass. This is a funding issue, not a validator failure, and should not trigger a failover.

The delinquency threshold used for detection is `failover.delinquent_slot_distance_override` (if configured) or the Agave default of 128 slots (~51 s).

## Failover Priority

By default, when multiple passive nodes are all eligible to take over, they use their public IP addresses (ascending sort) to break the tie. The node with the lowest IP gets rank 0 and takes over immediately; higher-ranked nodes wait `rank × poll_interval_duration` before attempting takeover.

Operators can override this ordering with explicit priorities:

```yaml
# On the node that should take over first (highest priority):
failover:
  priority: 0
  peers:
    backup-validator-1:
      ip: 192.168.1.11
      priority: 1
    backup-validator-2:
      ip: 192.168.1.12
      priority: 2

# On backup-validator-1:
failover:
  priority: 1
  peers:
    primary-validator:
      ip: 192.168.1.10
      priority: 0
    backup-validator-2:
      ip: 192.168.1.12
      priority: 2
```

**Rules:**

- Lower `priority` value = higher priority (rank 0 = takes over immediately).
- If any node declares a `priority`, **all** nodes (self + every entry in `failover.peers`) must declare one. A partially-configured cluster is rejected at startup.
- Priority values must be unique across self and all peers. Duplicates are rejected at startup.
- All nodes in the cluster should agree on the same priority ordering to avoid races. `solana-validator-ha` cannot enforce cross-node consistency, but logs the effective rank and ranking source (`config priority` vs `IP address`) at takeover time so mismatches are easy to spot.

## Failover Recording

When `failover.recording.enabled: true`, `solana-validator-ha` writes a JSON file to disk after every failover. The file captures everything needed for post-incident diagnosis: the gossip samples leading up to the failover, the full decision timeline, and the outcome.

### File naming

```
svha-<pubkey>-<timestamp>-<producer-ip>-recording.json
```

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `<pubkey>` | Active identity pubkey — shared across all HA peers, so files from different nodes for the same failover event share this prefix |
| `<timestamp>` | UTC time the failover was detected, formatted as `20060102T150405Z` |
| `<producer-ip>` | Public IP of the node that wrote the file, with dots replaced by underscores (e.g. `185_26_11_91`) |

Example: `svha-VotePubkey1111111111111111111111111111111111-20260331T143022Z-185_26_11_91-recording.json`

Because the timestamp is derived from each node's independent poll cycle, files from two nodes for the same failover event will have slightly different timestamps (up to one poll interval apart). Sort by `<pubkey>` first, then `<timestamp>` to find the matching pair.

### What is captured

Each recording file contains a single JSON object with:

- **`schema_version`** — format version for forward-compatible parsing
- **`node`** — identity of the node that wrote the file (name, public IP, passive pubkey)
- **`config`** — relevant configuration snapshot (poll interval, leaderless threshold, delinquency bypass, etc.)
- **`detected_at`** — UTC timestamp when the leaderless condition was first detected
- **`gossip_samples`** — up to the last 20 gossip samples collected before the failover, each with a timestamp, active/passive peer snapshots (IP, pubkey, vote slot), and the leaderless count at that point
- **`timeline`** — ordered list of decision events with timestamps and details (e.g. "delinquency bypass triggered", "takeover delay rank=1", "peer took over during delay — aborting")
- **`outcome`** — what happened: `became_active`, `aborted_peer_took_over`, `aborted_self_not_healthy`, or `aborted_other`

### Configuration

```yaml
failover:
  recording:
    enabled: true
    output_dir: "/var/log/solana-validator-ha/recordings"  # default: config file directory
```

The output directory is validated at startup — `solana-validator-ha` will refuse to start if it does not exist or is not writable.

### Replay

The `solana-validator-ha replay` command accepts one or more recording files and prints a merged, chronological timeline across all nodes — useful for correlating what each node observed during the same failover event.

```bash
solana-validator-ha replay \
  svha-VotePubkey111111111111111111111111111111111-20260331T143022Z-185_26_11_91-recording.json \
  svha-VotePubkey111111111111111111111111111111111-20260331T143025Z-186_233_187_141-recording.json
```

To find the matching file from the other node, filter by the shared `<pubkey>` prefix — all recordings for the same HA cluster carry the same pubkey. The timestamps will differ by a few seconds (each node detects the failover at a different point in its own poll cycle), so sort chronologically within that prefix to find the pair.

## Development and testing

```bash
make dev
make test
```

## Monitoring & Metrics

The application exposes Prometheus metrics on the configured port (default: 9090) and a health check endpoint on a separate configurable port (default: 9091):

### Core Metrics
- **`solana_validator_ha_metadata`**: Validator metadata with role and status labels
- **`solana_validator_ha_peer_count`**: Number of peers visible in gossip
- **`solana_validator_ha_self_in_gossip`**: Whether this validator appears in gossip (1=yes, 0=no)
- **`solana_validator_ha_failover_status`**: Current failover status
- **`solana_validator_ha_update_available`**: Whether a newer release is available (1=yes, 0=no). Updated on startup and periodically per `update.check_interval_duration`

### Metric Labels
- `validator_name`: Configured validator name
- `public_ip`: Validator's public IP address
- `validator_role`: Current role (active/passive/unknown)
- `validator_status`: Health status (healthy/unhealthy)
- Plus any configured static labels

### Health Endpoints
- **`/metrics`**: Prometheus metrics (on `prometheus.port`, default: 9090)
- **`/health`**: Basic health check (on `prometheus.health_check_port`, default: 9091)
